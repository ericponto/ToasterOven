# ToasterOven

ToasterOven is drag-and-drop based build tool. It's not meant to be a competitor to Grunt or Gulp or even something like CodeKit. Instead ToasterOven is best used for one-off builds.

## What it can do

The goal is to use only client-side technologies, so there is a limitted set to what we can do here (no SASS compiling, for example). Right now it's just:

* Minify JavaScript files via Uglify
* Minify CSS files via CSSMin
* Compile CoffeeScript files into JavaScript
* Concatenate files

## This is like alpha right now

There are probably problems, so open issues.
